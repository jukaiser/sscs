TODO:
	+ evaluate alternative pattern representation / generation
	+ probably: look at DB performance.
	+ check: could we afford saving targets with the reactions? (Probably not)
	+ cleanup code. Functions like mod () should be moved to a utillity module.
	+ merge show.c and recipe.c
	+ variant of pat_rle () with proper formatting (maximum line length!) and
	  writing directly to a given file. (For HUGE patterns)

BUGS:
	+ Improved delay calculation still NYI in recipe.c
	+ initial target NYI in recipe.c

FIXED:
	+ Fly-by detection
	+ Object (ship) detection / removal
	+ Fixed search_ships (), emit () and obj_back_trace () to get usable offsets
	  for emitted space ships
	+ (hopefully) fixed a mayor bug with tgt_adjust_lane ()
	  leading to completely wrong recipes :(
	+ removed some abundant SELECTs (checking for finished reactions).
	+ got rid of most UPDATE-Statements
	+ improved DB performance
	+ support for more then one rake type per project.
	+ reaction chaining.

Features missing:
	+ classification of patterns and reactions in a comment field in the db rows.
