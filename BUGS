TODO:
	+ evaluate alternative pattern representation / generation
	+ probably: look at DB performance.
	+ check: could we afford saving targets with the reactions? (Probably not)

BUGS:
	+ for targets with a period other then P1, P2 or P4 we have to RETHINK the
	  pregap calculations in tgt_collide() or adapt recipe.c
	  Three variants:
		- adjust preagap for period of target (i.e.: rephase bullet or target)
		- make tgt_collide () calculate the time saved and carry it thru the
		  entire reaction including saving it to the db.
		- Split pregap calculation off tgt_collide () and let recipe.c use
		  this function.
		- Don't use pulsars & Co., ever.

FIXED:
	+ Fly-by detection
	+ Object (ship) detection / removal
	+ Fixed search_ships (), emit () and obj_back_trace () to get usable offsets
	  for emitted space ships
	+ (hopefully) fixed a mayor bug with tgt_adjust_lane ()
	  leading to completely wrong recipes :(
	+ removed some abundant SELECTs (checking for finished reactions).
	+ got rid of most UPDATE-Statements

Features missing:
	+ support for more then one rake type per project.
	+ classification of patterns and reactions in a comment field in the db rows.
	+ reaction chaining.
