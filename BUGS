Fly-by detection:
	+ rework: do not requeue, rather restart handle ()
	+ Check for stabilization during fly-by detection.

Object (ship) detection:
	+ currently the detected object is back tracked to the first gen where it appeared.
	  It is then remove in this generation and pattern generation restarted at this gen.
	  (Because the detected ship would interfer with the check for a stabilized pattern).
	  As a result, heisenburps could lead to errors.
	  => remove the ship from EVERY generation - should be cheaper, anyway.

Config loader:
	+ FIX ME: use parse_constant () for array TOO!

Features missing:
	+ implement continuing an interrupted search by using the saved files provided by the previous run.
	+ support for more then one rake type per project.
	+ classification of patterns and reactions in a comment field in the db rows.
