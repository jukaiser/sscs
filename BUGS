BUGS:
	+ search_ships () should call emit () using the *relative* position of the emitted ship
	  against the initial target.
	  currently the "offX" and "offY" columns in the database are fed with meaningless absoulte
	  values.

FIXED:
	+ Fly-by detection
	+ Object (ship) detection / removal

Features missing:
	+ support for more then one rake type per project.
	+ classification of patterns and reactions in a comment field in the db rows.
	+ reaction chaining.
