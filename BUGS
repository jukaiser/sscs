Fly-by detection:
	+ rework: do not requeue, rather restart handle ()
	+ Check for stabilization during fly-by detection.

Object (ship) detection:
	+ currently the detected object is back tracked to the first gen where it appeared.
	  It is then removed in this generation and pattern generation restarted at this gen.
	  (Because the detected ship would interfer with the check for a stabilized pattern).
	  As a result, heisenburps could lead to errors.
	  => remove the ship from EVERY generation - should be faster, anyway.

Features missing:
	+ support for more then one rake type per project.
	+ classification of patterns and reactions in a comment field in the db rows.
