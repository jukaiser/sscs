This is work-in-progress.

Use as you see fit. Don't blame me for nothing.

Use .sql files under Schema for setting up a mysql database.
Edit test/default.cfg to reflect username, password and possible db-Host of that database.

Then (after running `make`) you could use

./sscs test/default.cfg

for stepping thru some demo-collision.

sscs is nothing more then a first prototype!
